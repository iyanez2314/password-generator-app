# Password generator app

#### This App was built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript this app was very fun and really made me think as far as the logic and all the use cases that a user can take when actaully generating a password. With the design approach I did the mobile first due to the fact that it is easier to scale up than it is to scale down.
